Integration package for [Buggregator](https://buggregator.dev/) with Yii.

## Installation

Install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require roxblnfk/yiigregator
```

If you use Yii with `composer-config-plugin`, the package might be configured via environment variables only.

## Usage

### Profiling

Turn on the profiler and set the Buggregator endpoint using environment variables.

```env
PROFILER_ENABLED=true
PROFILER_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/profiler/store
```

> [NOTE]:
> `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/profiler/store` is the default value for the Buggregator endpoint.

> [NOTE]:
> Depending on your environment, you may need to set the `PROFILER_ENDPOINT` to a different value.
> For example, if you are using Docker, you may need to set it to `http://buggregator:8000/api/profiler/store`.

By default, XHProf is used for profiling.
